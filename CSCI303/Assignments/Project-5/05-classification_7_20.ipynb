When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n","\n","Intro Videos: \n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lyiZMeTKIo\n","and\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItjXTieWKyI \n","\n","The `titanic_data.csv` file contains data for `887` of the real Titanic passengers.

Instead, it uses a model and dataset that you provide and runs the whole train-predict-score process for each of `k` folds (refer to the notes on Cross Validation for more information). The function returns a list of scores, one for each of the k folds. To get to a single score, it is possible to take the mean or median of this list of scores.
